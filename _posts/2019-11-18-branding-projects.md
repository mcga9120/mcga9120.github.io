Through my years in this field, I have found my footing as a graphic designer and travel photographer. After my studies at Sheridan College, I lived and worked in London, England for 2 years establishing myself in the design community. After a while of publishing my designs to an online platform called RedBubble, I picked up my first couple of clients. 

My first client was a special one, that I took great pride in branding from the ground up. The company Three Inches High is a sustainable, plant based beauty company owned and operated by my sister. She was the first person who really took a chance on me and my design abilities
