  When approaching my branding projects, I like to start by talking with the
  owner about their visions for the company and find out as much information as
  I can about how they see their business. The designs that I create need to
  encapsulate that vision and give their clients the same feeling about the
  business as the owner feels about it. 


  This business of mine started a little bit by accident. It wasn't my plan to
  start my own creative, but it's worked out for the best.  It has given me a
  great creative outlet to do what I love, and being able to see my work out in
  the world is the most amazing feeling.

Through my years in this field, I have found my footing as a graphic designer and travel photographer. After my studies at Sheridan College, I lived and worked in London, England for 2 years establishing myself in the design community. After a while of publishing my designs to an online platform called RedBubble, I picked up my first couple of clients. 

My first client was a special one, that I took great pride in branding from the ground up. The company Three Inches High is a sustainable, plant based beauty company owned and operated by my sister. She was the first person who really took a chance on me and my design abilities. I am really proud of this project, and continue to work with this company to build their brand even further. 

Another client of mine was a company called AtoZ Media, also a creative company specializing in real estate photography and videography. For this company I created the logo to reflect what the company is all about, while keeping it professional and in-keeping with the companies visions.
