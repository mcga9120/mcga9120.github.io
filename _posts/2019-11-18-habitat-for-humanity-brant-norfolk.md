Through the summer of 2019, I worked as a marketing assistant for Habitat for Humanity Brant-Norfolk. The summer internship involved creating marketing materials for their various different donation programs, such as their community fundraising program and their team build program. 

Another part of the internship was taking care of their various social media accounts, creating different campaigns and encouraging followers to join one of the programs. The campaign that I had the most hand in was the key messages campaign. This campaign was designed to get the messages of the company out to their community.
