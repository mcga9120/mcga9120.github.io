  This is an amazing organization, doing great work for my community, and it was
  such an honor to be apart of their team. When creating the marketing
  collateral and the messaging campaigns, I wanted to encapsulate what this
  company is all about. That's what the key messaging campaign was all about.
  Getting their positive messages and what they do out into the community. 


  That was the angle that I took when I was creating for this organization. I
  felt like our community needed to know and understand what they did and that's
  what I wanted to put in my designs.

Through the summer of 2019, I worked as a marketing assistant for Habitat for Humanity Brant-Norfolk. The summer internship involved creating marketing materials for their various different donation programs, such as their community fundraising program and their team build program. 

Another part of the internship was taking care of their various social media accounts, creating different campaigns and encouraging followers to join one of the programs. The campaign that I had the most hand in was the key messages campaign. This campaign was designed to get the messages of the company out to their community. 

Once the internship had reached a close, I decided to continue working with this great organization on a volunteer basis, to assist them in keeping their social media accounts and marketing collateral up to date.
