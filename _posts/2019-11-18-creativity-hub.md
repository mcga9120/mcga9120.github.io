For our Design Thinking 1 class, we worked in a group of 4 students on a client driven project called The Creativity Hub.

Our Hub was broken up into many different areas throughout the space. From photography, to music, to a kitchen for cooking classes, we thought of all the ways people in our community love to tell their stories.

We started our research from the very beginning, interviewing members of the student body, professors and other faculty, as well as community members in the downtown Brantford area. We conducted interviews, sent out a survey via social media, and did some observational research of our own, visiting similar spaces in London and Toronto.

From our research we were able to build a well versed high-fidelity prototype that assisted our clients in creating their vision.
