  The angle I took for this project started off with myself, thinking what kind
  of a space would I like to see come out of this. Part of being a UX designer
  is thinking of the users needs first, and in this case, I considered myself as
  one of the users. This space that was pitched to us by our clients really
  stood out to me as something that would shape the creativity in our community.
  It would bring so many like-minded people together in a common space where we
  could collaborate and create and bring out that inspiration in our community.

For our Design Thinking 1 class, we worked in a group of 4 students on a client driven project called The Creativity Hub.

Our Hub was broken up into many different areas throughout the space. From photography, to music, to a kitchen for cooking classes, we thought of all the ways people in our community love to tell their stories.

We started our research from the very beginning, interviewing members of the student body, professors and other faculty, as well as community members in the downtown Brantford area. We conducted interviews, sent out a survey via social media, and did some observational research of our own, visiting similar spaces in London and Toronto.

From our research we were able to build a well versed high-fidelity prototype that assisted our clients in creating their vision.
