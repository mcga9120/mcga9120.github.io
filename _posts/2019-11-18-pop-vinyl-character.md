  While I am still not completely over my hatred for this tool, I can say that I
  am now comfortable with it, and actually want to continue learning with this
  tool and using it more and more in my design work. I discovered that it is a
  very handy thing to know how to use as a designer, and I learned that the more
  you use it, the more capable you can with it. I look forward to continuing my
  process at grasping this great tool.

Working in Adobe Illustrator, my graphic design class learned the usefulness of the pen tool by creating ourselves as Pop Vinyl figures. Even though I am a working graphic designer, I had a love/hate relationship with the pen tool. I believe that stemmed from never actually learning how to use it properly, but nevertheless, I avoided using it at all costs until my class had these workshops and projects to do, strictly using this tool.
