  what I got out of sheridan

  why I want to continue my education
---
From 2013 until 2016, I studied Visual and Creative Arts at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. Through this program, I further discovered my love for visual design. We studied subjects such as life drawing, still-life painting, and the many different path ways of graphic and web design. 

The projects that mostly stood out to be as beneficial were our product design project, where my group created a brand of dark beer, and did the branding and design work from the ground up. I believe this project helped me mostly in my future branding projects, and allowed me to explore my creativity, while still adhering to the group dynamic and listening to their ideas and opinions as well. 

This program really launched my love for designing products for all kinds of different situations. Another project that brought about my love of design was a book project called "Passions". For this project, I interviewed students from all different programs around my school. I asked these participants about what their passion in life was, and printed them as quotes throughout the book along with pictures of the participants or something that went along with their passion. Through a service called Blurb, I had it bound and printed as an actual book in order to present it to my class.
