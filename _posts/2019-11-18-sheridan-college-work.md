  When I left Sheridan, I had a deeper understanding and appreciation for my
  love of visual design, but I wasn't entirely sure where I wanted to take it.
  From this schooling, I developed many useful skills such as a better
  understanding of the Adobe programs, layout designs, and how to pitch projects
  to clients and teams.


  I chose to continue my education as a UX Designer because I felt like it was a
  good next step for me, and it gave me a way to direct where I wanted to be in
  life. I'm glad I had the opportunities that I did at Sheridan, and all of the
  learning experiences that came along with it, but I can genuinely say with
  complete certainty that I am doing exactly what I want to be doing in life.
  I'm doing something that makes me happy and allows me to help others as well.

From 2013 until 2016, I studied Visual and Creative Arts at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. Through this program, I further discovered my love for visual design. We studied subjects such as life drawing, still-life painting, and the many different path ways of graphic and web design. 

The projects that mostly stood out to be as beneficial were our product design project, where my group created a brand of dark beer, and did the branding and design work from the ground up. I believe this project helped me mostly in my future branding projects, and allowed me to explore my creativity, while still adhering to the group dynamic and listening to their ideas and opinions as well. 

This program really launched my love for designing products for all kinds of different situations. Another project that brought about my love of design was a book project called "Passions". For this project, I interviewed students from all different programs around my school. I asked these participants about what their passion in life was, and printed them as quotes throughout the book along with pictures of the participants or something that went along with their passion. Through a service called Blurb, I had it bound and printed as an actual book in order to present it to my class.
