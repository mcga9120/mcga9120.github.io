myangle: When approaching these projects
---
In my time living abroad, I pick up some work at a branding and promotions company in London, England called Jack Nadel International. While working there, I took care of their self-promotion items. Each month they would choose a new product, and have it branded for them. They would then send it off to their clients as a "Product of the Month" to show off the different branding solutions that the company could offer. I would take care of the design work on the actual product, as well as a flyer and email blast explaining what the product was.
