  When approaching these projects, I wanted to match them to the month that they
  were coming out. If there was a special occasion going on that month, we would
  generally try to match up the products for that. So the one pictured to the
  right was something that I put together for out July product of the month.
  There isn't a special holiday over there in July, so we just made it summer
  themed and I was so proud at how that one turned out. It was the first project
  I had completed for this company.

In my time living abroad, I pick up some work at a branding and promotions company in London, England called Jack Nadel International. While working there, I took care of their self-promotion items. Each month they would choose a new product, and have it branded for them. They would then send it off to their clients as a "Product of the Month" to show off the different branding solutions that the company could offer. I would take care of the design work on the actual product, as well as a flyer and email blast explaining what the product was.
