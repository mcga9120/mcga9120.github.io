  My goal for this project is to create an information hub for aspiring service
  designers, and for people who have no idea what this field is. Every time I
  speak to someone about what I want to do in life, they don’t know what I’m
  talking about. They either had no idea that it was even a real thing that
  happened or just simply thought I was making something up. Well, with this
  information hub, aspiring service designers, such as myself, and people who
  are generally curious about the field, will be able to find all the
  information they need.

For a project such as this one, we need to be thinking about the users constantly. It’s going to be a large project, that includes a lot of information but my goal for this is to not leave anything out. I want everyone who visits this hub to have the information about service design that they could possibly need. For the initial mock-ups of this project, I have already started on some sketches for how I’d like the different screens to look and coming up with potential users. I’ll need to remember, however, to think about all the users together, rather than getting caught up in how I, myself, see things. To combat this, I plan to make a point of connecting with users throughout the whole process, and keep their views for the project front and center as to not get stuck designing for myself. I need to remember that I am designing this application in order to help make others lives easier and better.
